Inspired from [VirTex](https://github.com/kdexd/virtex): Learning Visual Representations from Textual Annotations

Karan Desai and Justin Johnson<br>University of Michigan 


Authors focused on learnning Visual representation of CNN using a transformer on top of CNN feature map to generate captions.
The idea is that by using captions, CNN may learn better representations than using only the labels of images.

I have implemented a basic model in Keras.
